## Description

This repository contains Python scripts to perform geometric computations such as:
- Verifying if given points form a rectangle or cuboid.
- Checking if a point lies inside the formed shape.
- Calculating the diagonal length of the shape.

The implementation supports both 2D and 3D cases, with extensions for arbitrary dimensions.

## Features :star:

- **2D Rectangle Verification** üü©: Check if four points form a rectangle.
- **Point Inclusion (2D)** üîµ: Determine if a point lies inside the rectangle.
- **Diagonal Calculation (2D)** ‚¨õ: Compute the diagonal length of the rectangle.
- **3D Cuboid Verification** üü¶: Extend functionality to verify cuboid formation.
- **Point Inclusion (3D)** üü™: Check if a point lies inside the cuboid.
- **Diagonal Calculation (3D)** üü´: Compute the spatial diagonal of the cuboid.
- **Arbitrary Dimensions** üîÑ: Support for higher-dimensional shapes.

## Task Description

### 1. 2D Rectangle Verification and Point Inclusion
- Input: Four points (A, B, C, X) in 2D space.
- Tasks:
  - Verify if A, B, and C form a rectangle.
  - If valid, check if point X lies inside the rectangle.
  - Calculate the diagonal of the rectangle.

### 2. 3D Cuboid Verification and Point Inclusion
- Input: Five points (A, B, C, D, X) in 3D space.
- Tasks:
  - Verify if A, B, C, and D form a cuboid.
  - If valid, check if point X lies inside the cuboid.
  - Calculate the spatial diagonal of the cuboid.

### 3. Arbitrary Dimensions
- Extend the above functionalities to handle n-dimensional spaces.

## Examples

### 2D Example
- **Input**: `0, 0`, `5, 0`, `0, 5`, `2, 2`
- **Output**: `True` (Point X is inside the rectangle.)

### 3D Example
- **Input**: `0, 0, 0`, `5, 0, 0`, `0, 3, 0`, `0, 0, 1`, `1, 1, 2`
- **Output**: `False` (Point X is outside the cuboid.)
