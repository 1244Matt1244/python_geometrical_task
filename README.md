The GitHub repository titled "python_geometrical_task" outlines a programming task focused on geometric computations. The repository contains Python scripts designed to perform specific geometric checks and calculations based on input coordinates read from files. The primary tasks and features of the repository are as follows:

### Task Description

1. **2D Rectangle Verification and Point Inclusion**:
   - The program should accept 2D coordinates of points A, B, C, and X as input, read from a file.
   - It must check if points A, B, and C can form a rectangle. If not, the program should terminate with an error message.
   - The program should determine if point X is inside the rectangle formed by A, B, and C and inform the user of the result.
   - The program should calculate the diagonal of the rectangle.

2. **3D Cuboid Verification and Point Inclusion**:
   - The program should be expanded to accept 3D coordinates of points A, B, C, D, and X.
   - It must check if points A, B, C, and D can form a cuboid.
   - The program should determine if point X is inside the cuboid formed by A, B, C, and D.
   - The program should calculate the spatial diagonal of the cuboid.

3. **Arbitrary Dimensions**:
   - The program should be further expanded to handle an arbitrary number of dimensions for all tasks.

### Examples of Input and Output

- **2D Example**:
  - Input: `0, 0`, `5, 0`, `0, 5`, `2, 2`
  - Output: `True`

- **3D Example**:
  - Input: `0, 0, 0`, `5, 0, 0`, `0, 3, 0`, `0, 0, 1`, `1, 1, 2`
  - Output: `False`
